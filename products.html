						At KEVIN.MURPHY we care about the environment and recognize the seriousness of dangerous climate change. We make every effort to do our part to help the environment by utilizing packaging that is recyclable or biodegradable.</p>

								<p class="pb-2"><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/medavita-product.jpg" class="image float-end" width="175" height="175" alt="" /></span>A lot has changed since Medavita was founded 50 years ago, but we still pursue the same ideals. All our products must offer the utmost efficacy right away, respecting the physiology of the scalp and hair. This means we cannot accept any compromises in our choice of ingredients: just essential oils and ultra-pure plant extracts selected with great care all over the world. And there are other people to take into consideration in the productive process: the people who work with us, and consumers. Efficacy, wellness and respect are Medavita’s keywords. <br><br>
								MEDAVITA, founded in 1963 and with its headquarters in Milan, is a family joint-stock company and the leading Italian brand for haircare treatments.
									The Company’s mission is to develop, manufacture and commercialise top-quality professional cosmetics for the beauty of hair. With more than 50 years’
									experience in this industry, MEDAVITA maintains its steadfast vocation of providing the best service by offering a wide range of products that meet the
									most demanding needs created by the far-reaching cosmetics world of today.</p>

									Through their work on-set and the salon floor to photoshoots and fashion shows, the dynamic duo recognised a gap in the market for a fresh, fun and self-explanatory range with products that simplify your hair and body care routine by doing exactly what they say they will.<br><br>
									Together with a hair and beauty obsessed team they helped to create ELEVEN Australia – a brand that embodies the Australian lifestyle.</p>

								<p class="pb-2"><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/k18-product.jpg" class="image float-end" width="175" height="175" alt="" /></span>K18 products contain K18Peptide's™. The K18 Peptide is the first long-chain peptide that can penetrate the hair cortex and <strong>permanently repair hair in just 4 minutes!</strong><br><br>
									Until now, haircare products covered up damage with conditioning treatments that coat hair in oils, bringing superficial hydration and sheen, while repair treatments patch damage like internal glue – strong but brittle—and provide temporary results.<br><br>
									K18 is the first product that actually heals your hair from the inside out.  </p>

								<h4><img src="assets/images/muk-logo.png" width="110"/></h4>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/muk-electrical.png" class="image float-end" alt="" /></span>muk™ is an exciting Australian owned professional haircare brand. Founded in Melbourne (Australia) in 2006, muk embarked on a journey to develop a brand that went against the trend of other haircare brands. Their vision was to create a range that not only out performed market leaders, but grabbed the imagination and attention of a saturated market place constantly bombarded with ‘scientific’ jargon and magical claims.<br /><br />
									muk launched its first product ‘Hard muk’ in late 2006. With just one product, muk became an overnight success. With its brightly coloured aluminium packaging, cheeky product names and provocative advertising, the brand was on everyone’s lips. Ten years later, they have become a market leader in professional haircare in Australia, a favourite with consumers worldwide and international distribution in nineteen countries.</p>
								muk is not just about great products. It’s a culture, a lifestyle and an attitude.<br />
									And more importantly they are a 100% independent, Australian owned brand.</p>
								All muk products are PETA approved.</p>
